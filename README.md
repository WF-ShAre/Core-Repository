# Core-Repository
The Core Repository includes base types of workflow components and life-cycle scripts to manage them.

The Repository consists of TWO parts:
1- Basic-type.yaml: a TOSCA-based description for the basic types and relationship of workflow components
2- LifeCycleScripts: a sub-repository includes scripts to manage life cycle operations of workflow components and their relationships
